### What is Express?
- Server logic is complicated as there are many steps involved in parsing an incoming request
- Express.js makes the process easier by allowing the isntall of other packages
- Express.js allows us to focus on the business logic rather than the nitty-gritty details
- Express.js is a framework of nodejs
    - A framework is a set of helper functions, tools, and rules that help you build your application

#### Alternatives to Express.js
- **Vanilla Node.js** - depending on the complexity of your application, Node.js could be all you need
- **Adonis.js** - a laravel inspired nodejs framework
- **Koa**, **Sails.js**, and many more...
- Express.js is by far the most popular
    - It is very flexible and doesn't add too much functionality out of the box
    - There are many third party libraries built specifically for express which is what makes it very appealing

### Installing Express.js
```bash
npm instal --save express
```
- We use ``--save`` because express will be a production dependency

```js
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

const server = http.createServer(app)
```


#### Express Source Code
- VS Code allows us to ``control + click`` on the express import and takes us to the source code:

export = e;
```
- This is a typescript file that exports a function allowing us to initialize a new object
    - Express.js stores and manages a lot of things for us behind the scenes

### Adding Middleware
- Express.js is all about middleware
- The app runs from top to bottom
```bash
Request ->

Middleware (req,res,next) => {...} ->
next()

Middleware (req,res,next) => {...} ->
res.send()

Response ->
```
- The nature of Express is that we can add middleware packages that give us middleware functions
```js
app.use()
```
- We call ``app.use`` after invoking express and before creating the server
- ``app.use`` allows us to use middleware functions, it accepts an array of request handlers
```js
app.use(() => {});
```
- The function passed to ``app.use()`` will be executed for every incoming request
```js
app.use((req,res,next) => {});
```
- ``app.use()`` takes three arguments that we can name as we choice
    - request, response, and next
    - next is a function that must be executed in order to travel onto the next middleware

**Calling next allows the request to continue**
```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("In the middleware");
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("In another middleware");
});

// 'In the middleware'
```
```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("In the middleware");
  next(); // Allows the request to continue to the next middleware in line
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("In another middleware");
});

// 'In the middleware'
// 'In another middleware'
```

### How Middleware Works
- We can still use ``res.write`` or ``res.setHeader``, but express gives us a new utility function ``res.send()``
    - We are can now attach a body of type any
```js
res.send(new Buffer('wahoo'));
res.send({ some: 'json' });
res.send('<p>some html</p>');
res.status(404).send('Sorry, cant find that');
```
- Using ``res.send()`` ends the process and won't run another middleware

### Express.js Looking Behind the Scenes
- [Express.js repo](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
- [response.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/lib/response.js)
- [application.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/lib/application.js)

**How express analyzes type of data**
```js
switch (typeof chunk) {
    // string defaulting to html
    case 'string':
      if (!this.get('Content-Type')) {
        this.type('html');
      }
      break;
    case 'boolean':
    case 'number':
    case 'object':
      if (chunk === null) {
        chunk = '';
      } else if (Buffer.isBuffer(chunk)) {
        if (!this.get('Content-Type')) {
          this.type('bin');
        }
      } else {
        return this.json(chunk);
      }
      break;
  }
```

**Shorten code to create server**
```js
const server = http.createServer(app);

server.listen(3000);
```
```js
// shortened code
app.listen(3000);
```

**How listen works under the hood**
```js
app.listen = function listen() {
  var server = http.createServer(this);
  return server.listen.apply(server, arguments);
};
```

### Handling Different Routes
- [``app.use([path,] callback [, callback...])``](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.use)
- optional first argument, ``path``
- default ``'/'`` (root path)
- The path for which the middleware function is invoked; can be any of:
    - A string representing a path.
    - A path pattern.
    - A regular expression pattern to match paths.
    - An array of combinations of any of the above.

- Callback functions; can be:
    A middleware function.
    A series of middleware functions (separated by commas).
    An array of middleware functions.
    A combination of all of the above.

- Because of the way the path argument works in looking for matches, ``/users`` will never be parsed using this order:
```js
app.use("/", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("the home page");
  res.send("<h1>The title</h1>");
});

app.use("/users", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("the user page");
  res.send("<ul><li>User 1</li><li>User 2</li><li>User 3</li></ul>");
});
```
- Because there is no ``next()``, ``'/users'`` will never be parsed.
- The path argument also looks for exact matches, and a single ``'/'`` can be applied to any path.
    - in this case, because of the placement of the code, ``'the home page'`` will be the only thing that is parsed
- The order matters and placing users first will produce the expected behavior:
```js
app.use("/users", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("the user page");
  res.send("<ul><li>User 1</li><li>User 2</li><li>User 3</li></ul>");
});

app.use("/", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("the home page");
  res.send("<h1>The title</h1>");
});
```

### Parsing Incoming Requests
**redirect(url: string): void**
    - Redirect to the given url with optional response status defaulting to 302.
    - The resulting url is determined by res.location(), so it will play nicely with mounted apps, relative paths, "back" etc.
- Examples:
    - res.redirect('back');
    - res.redirect('/foo/bar');
    - res.redirect('http://example.com');
    - res.redirect(301, 'http://example.com');
    - res.redirect('http://example.com', 301);
    - res.redirect('../login'); // /blog/post/1 -> /blog/login

**body-parser**
- should be available out of the box with express, however; it has been removed before
- recommended approach is to use third party library
```bash
npm install --save body-parser
```
```js
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
```
- best to place this before other middleware
- doesn't parse all types of files, this is used for things like forms
- ``{extended: false}`` due to bodyParser contructor being [deprecated](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24330014/bodyparser-is-deprecated-express-4)

### Limiting Middleware Execution to POST Requests
- ``use()`` works with all http methods
**app.get()**
- just as ``path`` is a form of filtering, ``app.get()`` is a form of filtering for get requests
**app.post()**
- filtering for ``post`` requests
